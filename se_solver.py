# This script solves a regular quadratic equation (a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0).
# The program receives parameters of the equation as a stream of numbers from the command line:
#
# > se_solver 3 4 5 0 4 -4 11 22 123 45 42 42 67 1001 â€¦
#
# All number are integers and some of them can be 0. 
#
# As result the script prints input numbers, textual representation of the equation and solution for the equation, 
# one line per equation.
#
# There are also unit tests for this script located in test_se_solver.py. 
# Description of how to run these tests and how to interpret test results could be found in README.md.
#
# About variables naming: 
# In the script I use 'a', 'b' and 'c' variables as coefficients of quadratic equation and
# x, x1, x2 as roots of quadratic equation
